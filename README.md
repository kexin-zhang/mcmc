# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation

MCMC in the web! Small demo of MCMC with Metropolis Hastings algorithm to simulate the normal distribution using a random walk. Proposal distribution is x(t) = x(t-1) + unif(-1, 1).

See this [blog post](https://www.kexinzhang.com/2018/10/29/simple-mcmc-demo.html) for the animation and a brief explanation of Markov Chains and MCMC.
